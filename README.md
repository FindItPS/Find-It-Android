### Save for Later ###
When out and about the shop's users may want to have a list of the items they have found on Find It! to purchase. When searching, users can add an item to the cart, saving information such as name, price, link and location.

Users can also later export their cart in a text or email to people in their contact for their viewing. This will share all the information that is saved when the item gets added to the cart

### App Themes ###
Not everyone enjoys a green color palette and at Find It! we understand that. To facilitate a pleasant UI for every user we have added a wide variety of themes to pick from, ranging from the purple amethyst theme to the warm summer theme.
